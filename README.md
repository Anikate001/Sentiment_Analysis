Fake News Detection
A machine learning project that detects fake news articles using Python and popular data science libraries. This repository demonstrates end-to-end text classification, from data upload and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

Dataset
Source: WELFake Dataset (uploaded as WELFake_Dataset.csv)

Columns: text (news content), label (1 = fake news, 0 = real news)

Workflow
Package Installation:
All required Python packages are installed and upgraded for compatibility in Google Colab.

Data Upload:
The CSV file is uploaded directly into the notebook.

Preprocessing:

Lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword filtering, lemmatization using NLTK.

Cleaned text is stored in a new column.

Vectorization:
TF-IDF is applied to transform text documents into feature vectors.

Model Training:
A logistic regression model is trained to classify news articles as fake or real.

Evaluation:
Accuracy, confusion matrix, and ROC curve are calculated to assess model performance.

How to Run
Clone the repository and launch the Colab notebook.

Upload your WELFake_Dataset.csv file when prompted.

Execute the provided code cells sequentially as described in the notebook.

Review model results and sample predictions.

Example Results
Accuracy: Achieves high accuracy on test set for binary classification.

Sample predictions: Displays correct/incorrect samples for model interpretation.

ROC Curve: Illustrates model's performance across different thresholds.

Dependencies
Python 3.x

pandas, numpy, scikit-learn

nltk (with stopwords, punkt, wordnet downloads)

wordcloud, plotly, seaborn, matplotlib

Visualization
WordClouds provide insights into common words for fake and real news classes.

Fake News Detection
This project uses machine learning to automatically classify news articles as fake or real. The approach demonstrates text preprocessing, feature extraction, and binary classification using logistic regression.

Dataset
Name: WELFake_Dataset.csv

Contains: text column (news content), label column (0 for real, 1 for fake)

Steps
Install dependencies:
Packages like pandas, scikit-learn, nltk, wordcloud, and plotly.

Data upload:
Upload the CSV file in Colab.

Preprocessing:
Lowercase, remove punctuation, tokenize, lemmatize, and remove stopwords.

Feature extraction:
Use TF-IDF vectorizer for converting text to numeric features.

Model training:
Logistic Regression for classification.

Evaluation & Visualization:
Accuracy score, confusion matrix, classification report, ROC curve, and WordClouds for class insights.

How to Run
Clone the repo, open the notebook in Google Colab.

Upload WELFake_Dataset.csv when prompted.

Run cells step-by-step: installation, preprocessing, training, and evaluation.

Example Results
Accuracy: >80% (varies by split)

Confusion Matrix & ROC: Shows model performance visually

WordClouds: Quick view of common terms in each class

Requirements
pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, nltk, wordcloud, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly (all installed in first code cell)
