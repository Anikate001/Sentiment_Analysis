Sentiment Analysis on Social Media/Product Reviews Using BERT
Overview
This project implements sentiment analysis of social media posts and product reviews leveraging transformer-based language models, specifically BERT. It classifies text into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment categories. The goal is to build a robust and explainable sentiment classification tool applicable for customer feedback analysis, brand monitoring, and social media insights.

Features
End-to-end NLP pipeline: data preprocessing, tokenization, and stopword removal.

Fine-tuning of pre-trained BERT for domain-specific sentiment classification.

Model evaluation using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics for comprehensive performance assessment.

Attention visualization to explain model predictions and enhance interpretability.

Modular codebase for easy adaptation to other text classification problems.

Dataset
The data used consists of publicly available social media posts and product reviews sourced from [mention source if applicable].

Text cleaning includes removal of noise, emojis, URLs, and irrelevant symbols ensuring better model accuracy.

Installation
Clone the repository:

text
git clone https://github.com/Anikate001/Sentiment_Analysis.git
Create and activate Python virtual environment:

text
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
Install dependencies:

text
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the Jupyter notebook Sentiment_Analysis_BERT.ipynb to explore detailed code, model training, and evaluation steps.

Adjust hyperparameters or switch datasets as needed.

Visualize attention maps directly within the notebook.

Results
Achieved high accuracy with precision, recall, and F1-score above [insert your metric numbers here].

Attention visualization offers insights on which words influenced model predictions.

Model is suited for deployment in real-world sentiment monitoring systems.

Future Work
Extend to multi-lingual sentiment analysis.

Incorporate aspect-based sentiment classification.

Develop a real-time sentiment tracking dashboard or API.
